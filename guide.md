## setup
1. go to Settings -> Apps -> Shortcuts -> Advanced -> Allow running scripts. This is so All The Icons can get your chosen icon from the database

## how to choose icons
Recommended sets: tabler, lucide, streamline flex

At first, this wont work because of Shortcuts restrictions.
1. **choose your icon** or use the search bar
2. **Tap the Share button** at the bottom (The box with the arrow)
3. **Share to "All The Icons"**
4. Customize and hit "Done" when ready

## extra: create styled menus
1. choose and **add icons** to your collection
2. go to **your collection**
3. copy icon(s) in **vCard format**
4. go to **your shortcut** and **paste the text** in a text block
5. Add a **Set Name** action. Set the name of Text to **menu.vcf**
6. Add a **Get Contacts from Input**
7. Finally, add a **Choose From List action**
